This grant will support the work of the Clarity Lab in launching an Ecosystem DAO for the Stacks community. The mission is simple - to empower and engage. 

Being based on Executor DAO the Stacks Ecosystem DAO will be very modular allowing the community to evolve the project in a number of directions. Our initial direction is to launch as a Builder/Contributor DAO, a tool to empower community members to receive funds for contributions directly. The STX ECO DAO will allow the community to have a voice in key decision making processes such SIP activation criteria, grants programs, etc. The hope is that these decisions will ultimately rest with the stacks community.

The core engineering work for the project is being provided by the Clarity Lab. We are looking to the Foundation to support us in the following areas;
